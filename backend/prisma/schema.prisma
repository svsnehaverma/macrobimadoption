//A Prisma Schema file contains the following: Generator, Datasource and the data model!
//A) Generator: defines which client should be generated based on the data model
//when running prisma generate command. 
//Eg: Prisma Client is generated in node_modules/prisma/client folder
//and it contains all the commands to query the models from th db!
//Once it's generated, we can use the PrismaClient class in our backend
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

//B) defines connection to the db: [run npx prisma generate when changing url!]
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL")  
}

//C) Data model:
model Questionnaires {
  questionId  Float    @unique
  title       String
  choices     String[]
  chartType   Chart    @default(undefined)
  campaign    String   @default("")
  sectionName String   @default("")

  //relations (to another model):
  answers Answers[]
}

enum Chart {
  bar
  pie
  table
  undefined
}

model Answers {
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())

  questionTitle String
  userAnswer    String?
  userEmail     String

  assigAuditor String?
  auditorNote  String?
  hashtags     String?
  stateLabels  String?
  verifStatus  String?

  //relations (to another model) by using the @relation attribute:
  questionnaire Questionnaires @relation(fields: [questionId], references: [questionId])
  questionId   Float //foreign key in database

  user   Users @relation(fields: [userId], references: [userId])
  userId Float

  //unique blocks | multi-field unique (column does not appear in table, but you can use this field even to query an item, cool!)
  @@unique(fields: [questionId, userId], name: "questionId_userId") //this combination has to be unique, we can use name to later query from prismaClient where:{...}
}

model Users {
  userId          Float   @unique //since those are big integers, use float to not be limited in size!
  userEmail       String
  userName        String
  userLabels      String?
  country         String
  academicProgramme String[] //it returns null sometimes, make it @default("")??

  //relations (to another model):
  answers Answers[]
}

//commands:
//prisma format | it formats the prisma file, really cool!
//prisma migrate dev --name init | it uses the prisma schema to modify/create the database schema in PGadmin, etc...
//so we call this every time we finished updating the prisma schema file to keep the database schema synchronized with the updates.
//it also calls the prisma generate command (if you've installed @prisma/client package)
//at the end to generate the prisma client ORM that enables to query the db
//prisma db push | It also syncs the prisma schema with the database schema
//with except that it does not generate a migration. Convenient to be used with mongoDB to evolve the database schema

//In production:
//prisma migrate deploy | it syncs migration history from dev env with database in prod env.
//It should be run in an automated CI/CD environment (eg. github actions)
//if there is no migration folder [mongoDB setup], keep using prisma db push
